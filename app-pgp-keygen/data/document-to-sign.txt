Box-drawing characters, also known as line-drawing characters, are a form of semigraphics widely used in text user
interfaces to draw various geometric frames and boxes. Box-drawing characters typically only work well with monospaced
fonts.

In graphical user interfaces, these characters are much less useful as it is more simple and appropriate to draw lines
and rectangles directly with graphical APIs. However, they are still useful for command-line interfaces and plaintext
comments within source code.
