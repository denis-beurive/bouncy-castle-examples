# 0x1F: Signature directly on a key

> This signature is calculated directly on a key. It binds the
> information in the Signature subpackets to the key, and is
> appropriate to be used for subpackets that provide information
> about the key, such as the Revocation Key subpacket.  It is also
> appropriate for statements that non-self certifiers want to make
> about the key itself, rather than the binding between a key and a
> name.
